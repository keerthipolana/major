<h1 className='link'>COMPANY OVERVIEW</h1>
<div className="space">
<p>
Bosch in India has a good reason to celebrate: The Companyâ€™s activities on the subcontinent began a century ago. The exact date is well known: on September 1, 1922, Bosch signed a contract with Illies & Co. Under this agreement, the long-established Hamburg-based trading company, with its extensive knowledge of local market conditions, was to sell Bosch products in India. From there, the path led via licensed production in the 1950s to Bosch's current regional companies in India.<br/><br/>
The reasoning for starting business in India was simple: a century ago, the Indian subcontinent offered tremendous opportunities for Bosch. Automobiles needed an ignition system, and Bosch wanted to make its globally successful magneto ignition the standard in India as well.
