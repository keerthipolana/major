Eastman history<br/>
When World War I made it hard to get raw materials, Eastman Kodak founder George Eastman wanted an independent supply of chemicals for his photographic processes. After the war, he turned his attention to the forests of the southern U.S. In 1920, Tennessee Eastman was born in Kingsport. In the coming decades, the company created to deliver a handful of chemicals quickly became a creative force in the materials industry.<br/><br/>

<h1>A history of innovation</h1><br/><br/>
In 1994, Eastman Chemical Company spun off from Eastman Kodak to become an independent corporation. Today, we’re a global specialty materials company. Our many products include innovative films for electric vehicles, resins that make high-performance medical devices more durable, and recycled Eastman Renew materials for sustainable water bottles and cosmetic cases. And those materials still bear the name of the man who started it all: George Eastman.
