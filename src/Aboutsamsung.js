            <h1>The History of Samsung (1938-Present)</h1>
            <p>The Samsung Group is a South Korea-based conglomerate that includes several subsidiaries. It's one of the largest businesses in Korea, producing nearly one-fifth of the country's total exports with a primary focus on electronics, heavy industry, construction, and defense. Other major subsidiaries of Samsung include insurance, advertising, and entertainment.</p><br/>
            <h1>Samsung's Beginnings</h1>
            <p>
            With only 30,000 won (about US$27), Lee Byung-chul started Samsung as a trading company based in a city called Taegu in 1938. With 40 employees, Samsung began as a grocery store, trading and exporting goods produced in and around the city. It sold dried Korean fish and vegetables, as well as its own noodles.
            </p><br/>
            <h1>1960 to 1980</h1>
            <p>In the 1960s, Samsung entered the electronics industry with the formation of several electronics-focused divisions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Samsung Electronics Devices</li>
                <li>Samsung Electro-Mechanics</li>
                <li>Samsung Corning</li>
                <li>Samsung Semiconductor & Telecommunications</li>
            </ul>

            </h1>
            <p>
            Samsung entered the phone market with the SPH-1300, an early touch-screen prototype released in 2001. The company also developed the first speech-recognition phone in 2005.<br/>

In the late 2000s and early 2010s, Samsung acquired companies that developed technologies for electronic devices. In 2011, Samsung released the Galaxy S II, followed in 2012 by the Galaxy S III, one of the world's most popular smartphones. The year 2012 also marked Samsung becoming the world's largest mobile phone maker and the acquisition of mSpot to provide entertainment to Samsung device users.<br/>

The company made additional acquisitions in the following years, including organizations that would help it expand its offerings in medical technology, smart TVs, OLED displays, home automation, printing solutions, cloud solutions, payment solutions, and artificial intelligence.<br/>

In September 2014, Samsung announced the Gear VR, a virtual reality device developed for use with the Galaxy Note 4. By 2015, Samsung had more U.S. patents approved than any other company, with more than 7,500 utility patents granted before the end of the year.<br/>

In 2017, Samsung was given governmental permission to test a self-driving car. The following year, Samsung announced that it would expand its renewable energy plans and hire 40,000 employees over the next three years.
