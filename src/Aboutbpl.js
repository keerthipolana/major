<h1 className='link'>COMPANY OVERVIEW</h1>
<div className='space'>
<p>
Established in 1963 to manufacture Electrocardiograph machines and Panel Meters, BPL quickly grew to become the first truly world-class Indian consumer electronics brand.<br/><br/>

In the 1990s BPL televisions, refrigerators, and washing machines revolutionized Indian homes through their high quality, elegant designs and superior technology. BPL products were on par with world-leading brands and came at a price that was within reach of the common man. No longer was world-class quality something that had to be imported and thus the preserve of the rich.<br/><br/>

Over the years, we have earned the trust of millions of loyal BPL customers across India, who fondly recall their first BPL TV or refrigerator, which many still use even today.<br/><br/>

BPL is proud to present this legacy of quality, elegance and affordability to you, the discerning quality conscious consumer of this generation.
