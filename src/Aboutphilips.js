<h4>130 years of innovation</h4><br/><br/>

Innovation has been a top priority at Philips ever since the company was founded in 1891, but it wasn’t until 1914 that innovation really took off when Philips opened the Philips Research Laboratories (NatLab). These laboratories, where some of the world’s finest scientists worked together on ground-breaking inventions, went on to become one of the leading research centers in the world.<br/><br/>

 

By listening carefully to the needs of our customers, they have achieved two breakthrough innovations in the field of X-ray: the Metalix in 1924 and the Rotalix in 1929. The Metalix was the first X-ray tube with a metal housing to provide protection against harmful X-ray radiation. The tube was also compact and that meant it could be used for patients at home. In 1929 Philips developed a revolutionary new tube – the Rotalix – which significantly improved the quality of X-ray images. Thanks to this X-ray tube it was possible to obtain images of not just bones but also organs like the heart and the lungs. This represented enormous progress. The principle of the Rotalix is still used in X-ray tubes for medical applications today.
