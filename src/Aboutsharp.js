<h3>Sharp History</h3>
It’s all in the name. <br/><br/>

Born of a vision to continuously innovate to improve the user experience, Sharp is the brainchild of founder Tokuji Hayakawa, inventor of the world’s first mechanical pencil - the Ever-Sharp. The namesake of the business, this invention, among many, set the precedence for Sharp’s development of industry and world-first products.<br/><br/> 

Establishing Sharp in 1912, Hayakawa set out on a path to change people’s lives and businesses worldwide with a sincere and creative spirit. This spirit is embedded in the Sharp family culture and the contributions Sharp makes to society through technology and manufacturing, generation after generation.
